\section{Introduction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Project Motivation
            \begin{description}
                In 2021, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) fielded nearly 390,000 reports of credit card fraud, making it one of the most common kinds of fraud in the U.S.\cite{Bankrate} This issue is expected to total \$165.1 billion over the next 10 years. Due to the serious damage that this issue cause to our society on a daily basis, it is beneficial to address this issue with the help of machine learning technology.
            \end{description} 
        %Why is credit card fraud detection important? The impact of credit card fraud on financial institutions and consumers. 
        \item Objective
            \begin{description}
                In this project, the ultimate goal is to develop a reliable machine learning model that detect fraudulent credit card transactions. In doing that, it is required to analyze the dataset well for its distributions and engineer the appropriate machine learning model that best capture the relationship between the target variable and the features.                
            \end{description}
        %What is the main goal of the project? (Building a model to detect fraudulent transactions.) Also mention the dataset and tools you plan on using.
